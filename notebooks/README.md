put experiments. Create a timestamped folder for each experiment: e.g.
`20160101_first_data_exploration`. 

Jupyter notebook is not recommended. Use [Marimo notebook](https://marimo.io/) instead if possible.  At the same time, try to incorporate as
much code as possible into the library for reusability.
